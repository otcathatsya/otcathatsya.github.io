# About Me!

Hi! My name's Cath, although you may find me using `otcathatsya` online sometimes, which is a
barely disguised embedding of my name in a word from the book series &
show [Shadow and Bone](https://thegrishaverse.fandom.com/wiki/Otkazat%27sya).

I am a comp sci PhD student at JÃ¼lich Research Center, Germany, studying somewhere between the lines of machine learning
and comp. neuroscience.

I am a member of [NEST](https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator){:target="_
blank"} <a href="https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator" target="_blank" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;">
<img src="{{ '/assets/images/nest.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Logo" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: middle; border-radius: 5%; margin-bottom: 0.25em; border: none;">
</a> and my current project is about accelerating simulations of spiking nets with realistic synaptic density on
alternative hardware, more specifically [Graphcore's IPU](https://www.graphcore.ai/),
by designing algorithms that can exploit distributed memory and massive parallelism. My hope is to publish the code
alongside the future paper, so stay tuned!

Beyond work I am partial to mountains, climbing them, books (I had a goodreads once but got too lazy), travel,
languages, politics and games. Big music enthusiast and amateur vinyl collector.
Reckon there's a STEM stereotype hidden in there somewhere. Did I mention that I love bubble tea?

## This is where I advertise projects


In no particular order:

- [**Simple Tabs**](https://github.com/otcathatsya/simple-tabs) As an occassional MC dev I can't get around advertising
  the one mod I actually bothered getting into a semi-polished state.
  It adds chat tabs to filter incoming messages!
- [**NEST Simulator**](https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator) The de-facto standard for large-scale spiking neural
  network simulations. Very well maintained, glad to be a small part of its development!
- [**Remote Camera**](https://github.com/otcathatsya/uclan-remotecamera) Something I wrote back for my BSc, this is a
  very messy but functional app that lets you stream the camera feed of one Android device to the other and send-back
  captured images based on WiFi-Direct.
